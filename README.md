# KhumaloCraft Emporium 
## About
KhumaloCraft Emporium is an e-commerce platform designed to showcase and sell handcrafted products from artisans around the world. This project is part of a school assignment and serves as a practical application of web development concepts using C# and Visual Studio.

The website provides a space for artisans to share their unique crafts and for customers to discover and purchase these unique items. It features various categories of products, each with detailed descriptions and pricing information. Additionally, the platform will offers discount bundles and special promotions to enhance the shopping experience.

This project is an opportunity to learn and apply various aspects of web development, including front-end design with HTML and CSS, back-end development with C#, and database management. Through this project, I aim to create a user-friendly interface, efficient performance, and secure transactions.
