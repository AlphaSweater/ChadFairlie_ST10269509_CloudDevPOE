Scope:

Background:
James Khumalo, a visionary entrepreneur, set out to establish KhumaloCraft Emporium as a global e-commerce platform to showcase handcrafted products. His dream involves connecting artisans worldwide with a discerning audience. However, for this dream to become realty, KhumaJoCraft Emporium needs a scalable, accessible, and user-friendly platform. 

Achieving this requires an understanding of basic cloud computing and the various service models; and a platform that is accessible globally, which is usable and ensures a positive user experience. Once the craftwork and its related details have been built into a suitable platform to showcase the work, it is necessary that the platform be deployed to enable accessibility and advertising the work.

James envisioned a platform accessible to a global audience, scalable to accommodate growth, and ensuring a secure and enjoyable shopping experience. The challenges include making crucial decisions on cloud service models and deployment strategies, as well as designing an efficient database schema for product information and user data, while ensuring scalability with the platform's growth. The development team faces technical challenges such as global accessibility, scalability, and ensuring a seamless user experience. 

Lastly, James would like to include advanced serves and functionalities to enhance user experience and advanced features, such as search capabilities, notifications, serverless services, and automation.

The entire goal of KhumaloCraft is to have a web application which is accessible, stores the artisans' craftwork, and allows customers globally to access and order their craftwork. Therefore, the following needs to be completed:
- Demonstrate an understanding of cloud computing and its relevance in solving this problem.
- Development of a basic web application to provide background information on the company and their services.
- Deploying the web application on a suitable Azure platform.

Develop a web application
Develop a web application using ASP.NET which Will assist KhumaloCraft to advertise their work. 
Your web application should include the following:
- A **Home**, **About Us**, **Contact Us**, and a **My Work** page with the necessary information.
- The My Work page should include information about the work KhumaloCraft does. Such information should include images, craftwork, and prices of the craftwork. This information should be added as static information upon development of the web application. (In Part 2 of the POE the information will be included as part of a database integration.)|
